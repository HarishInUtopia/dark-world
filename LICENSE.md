Hello, traveler! 👋
This repository isn't just lines of code—it is a digital fragment of my soul, my philosophy, and my "Dark Utopia." Because this is a personal creation, it is **NOT** Open Source.

Here is the deal:

✨ WHAT YOU CAN DO:
1. **Look & Learn:** You are welcome to explore the code to see how I built my world.
2. **Be Inspired:** If you like the vibe, let it inspire you to build *your own* unique space from scratch.

🚫 WHAT YOU CANNOT DO:
1. **No Cloning:** Do not fork, copy, or duplicate this repository for your own public or private use.
2. **No Copy-Pasting:** You cannot take my code, design, or layout and use it for your own website or commercial projects.
3. **Hands Off The Assets:** My photos, my "Life Policies," and my specific design theme are strictly personal. They belong to me, Harish.

💫 A GENTLE REMINDER:
Being original is cool. Copying someone else's safe space is not.

If you steal this code:
1. It’s bad karma. 🌑
2. I hope your phone charger only works at a very specific, annoying angle. 🔌
3. Your coffee will always be slightly too cold. ☕

**Create your own magic. Don't steal mine.**
